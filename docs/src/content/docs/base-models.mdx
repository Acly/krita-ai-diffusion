title: Base Models
description: Overview of the different diffusion models supported by the plugin
---
The Krita AI Diffusion plugin works with various different model architectures,
also known as base models. These models are refined, extended and supported by
various other models (LoRA, ControlNet, IP-Adapter) which must match the base
architecture. **Extensions between different base models are not compatible!**

You can install multiple base models with their extensions side by side.
Most common are:
* [Stable Diffusion 1.5 (SD1.5)](#stable-diffusion-1.5)
* [Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)](#stable-diffusion-xl)

The following base models have limited support:
* [Flux](https://github.com/Acly/krita-ai-diffusion/discussions/1176)
* [Stable Diffusion 3.5 (SD3.5)](https://github.com/Acly/krita-ai-diffusion/discussions/1328)

### Stable Diffusion 1.5

Released in October 2022 this is the older of the two base models. It was
trained on 512x512 images originally, although custom checkpoints also work well
for resolutions up to 768. It is still suitable for much higher resolutions by
generating a low resolution image first and then upscaling it - the Plugin will
do this automatically.

Advantages of SD 1.5:
* Requires less GPU memory (VRAM)
* Requires less disk space
* More community content available (checkpoints, LoRA)
* Wider range of control modes available

### Stable Diffusion XL

Released in July 2023 this is a newer base model designed for higher fidelity.
It was trained on images with a total of 1024x1024 pixels (various aspect
ratios).

Advantages of SD XL:
* Better quality at high resolutions
* Improved understanding of text prompts

## Installation
When using the Plugin's automatic installer you can select which base model
("workload") you want to install. You have to choose at least one, but can opt
to install both.

Optional packages and extensions listed below are available for selection
depending on whether the base workload is installed. Some packages like
upscalers are unrelated to diffusion and work for both, others have separate
packages available for each version. Not all extensions exist for both versions.

## Styles
Styles indicate which base model version they use with an icon. This is derived
from the selected checkpoint, which can be either SD1.5 or SDXL. Any LoRA you
add must match the base model.

Note that the Plugin automatically filters styles for workloads you don't have
installed. In the Style configuration menu you will see a notification if there
is an issue.
