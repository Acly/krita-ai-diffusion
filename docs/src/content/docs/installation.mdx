This is a step-by-step guide for downloading and installing the Generative AI plugin for Krita.

## Installing the Plugin

<Steps>

1. Make sure you have Krita version **2.2** (or later) installed.

   You can download and install it from <ExternalLink href="https://krita.org/en/download">krita.org</ExternalLink>.

2. Download the Plugin

    Download the <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/Acly/krita-ai-diffusion/releases/latest">latest release</ExternalLink> of the Plugin.
    Remember where you save the ZIP file.

3. Install the Plugin

    Run Krita. Go to _Tools â–¸ Scripts â–¸ Import Python Plugin from File..._

    ![Import the Python plugin](../../assets/installation/import-python-plugin.webp)
    
    Select the ZIP file you just downloaded. When prompted to enable the Plugin, press Yes.

    ![Enable the Plugin](../../assets/installation/enable-plugin.webp)
    
    _Now Krita needs to be restarted!_

4. Enable the Docker
        
    In Krita, create a new Document. For starters, choose a low resolution.

    ![Create a new document](../../assets/installation/create-document.webp)
    
    Enable the Plugin Docker from the Menu bar: _Settings â–¸ Dockers â–¸ ðŸ—¹ AI Image Generation_

    ![Enable the Docker](../../assets/installation/enable-docker.webp)
    

5. Configure Image Generation
                    
    The Plugin is installed now and you should see the Docker appear.

    ![The plugin Docker](../../assets/installation/plugin-docker.webp)
    
    To generate images you also need a backend server. Click Configure to choose between multiple options:

    ![Server options](../../assets/installation/server-options.webp)
    
    * **Local Managed Server**

        The Plugin will download and install the server on your system.<br />
        Requires a powerful GPU!
        Continue reading [below](#local-server-installation) for details.

    * **Online Service**

        Create an account and generate images on cloud GPU workers.<br />
        This requires no installation or hardware on your end. [Pricing and Terms](https://www.interstice.cloud/service)

    * **Custom Server**

        The Plugin can connect to an existing [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) server, either local or remote.
        
        Read about [required custom nodes and models here](/comfyui-setup).
        This is the most flexible option, but some technical knowledge is required.

        <Aside type="caution">If you choose this option, it is your responsibility to install and run the server. Instructions and tutorials for ComfyUI can be found online.</Aside>

6. Connect to Online Service _(Optional)_

    Press the Sign in button. This should open your browser, where you need to
    log in, or sign up for an account.

    ![Sign in](../../assets/installation/sign-in.webp)
    
    Once done, you should see the confirmation screen and can start generating
    images!

## Local Server Installation

These steps are only required if you selected **Local Managed Server** as the backend.

<Steps>
1. Hardware requirements

    <table className="mb-2">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><Icon name="bootstrap/nvidia" /> NVIDIA</td>
                <td>GTX 1060 6GB or better.<br /><Soft>You may encounter issues and limitations on older cards.</Soft></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><Icon name="bootstrap/amd" /> AMD</td>
                <td>12GB VRAM or more. Slow with limited feature set.<br /><Soft>Custom install required for Linux.</Soft></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><Icon name="bootstrap/apple" /> Apple</td>
                <td>Apple Silicon via MPS (community support).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>CPU</td>
                <td>Works, but is very slow.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    _Please make sure you are using an up-to-date GPU driver!_

2. Operating System
                    
    Windows, Linux or macOS

    <Hint>
        <Icon name="awesome/linux" /> <Icon name="bootstrap/apple" /> _Linux and macOS users_

        Python with venv must be installed. Recommended version: 3.11 or 3.12.<br />
        This is usually available via package manager, eg. `apt install python3-venv`
    </Hint>

        <Icon name="awesome/linux" /> _Linux users_

        Some packages cannot be installed while running the **Flatpak** version of Krita.
        It is recommended to use the **AppImage** instead.
    </Hint>

3. Installation

    1. Choose a path where to install.<br />
        <Soft>Keep in mind AI models can be very large, 10GB is a minimum, 50GB+ not unusual depending on optional packages.</Soft>
    2. Choose a backend. CUDA only works for NVIDIA GPUs. Use DirectML for AMD.
        <Soft>Make sure to do this _before_ you install!</Soft>
    3. Select packages. You need at least one workload and one checkpoint.<br />
        <Soft>Everything else is optional and will considerably increase download size. You can come back later and add packages at any time.</Soft>
    4. Click install!
