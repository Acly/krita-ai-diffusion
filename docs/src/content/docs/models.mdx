import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This is a non-exhaustive list of model files which can be used with the Krita AI
Diffusion plugin.

### Model filters

To list the minimum required models for the plugin to work, select the
_Required_ model set and the [base model](/base-models) you want to use below. Make
sure all model type filters are enabled.

When _optional_ models are enabled, the list will include a (large) number of
additional models. _ControlNet_, _IP-Adapter_ and _Clip Vision_ provide the
various [control layers](/control-layers). _Upscaler_ models add more options to
the upscale workspace.

_Checkpoint_ lists the recommended diffusion models used by the plugin's default styles.
They are all optional, you are free to use your preferred models.

### Downloading models

Each model file has a download link which you can use to fetch the model weights.
Make sure to put them in the indicated folder inside your ComfyUI installation.

<Aside type="caution">
In some cases it is necessary to rename the model file!
